# Circle-Limit
The project is a C++ application that generates a graphical representation of a star using OpenGL. It includes a Poincare texture and allows the star to rotate around a point and itself. The star's shape can be adjusted, and the texture's resolution and filtering mode can be modified. The project uses a 2D camera for viewing.
